# reaction-time-game

## 🕹️ Idea

To improve my coding skills and spend my time more productively (e.g. not on social media 😀) I want to start coding daily. It should be daily, no matter for how long.
Since I had no idea **what** to code, I asked Chat-GPT and this is the first game I got. Hopefully many more will follow. 🚀
To really understand the concept and internalize it, I will follow a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. 🔁

## 🎯 Game Description

"Reaction Time Game" measures how fast you can click a randomly appearing button - pretty easy, but it's the first game, so I will start slowly 😅

## ⚙️ Features

- Random button appearance
- Reaction time measurement
- Adding 0.5sec for missclicks as kind of penalty
- Sound effects
- Highscore tracking (planned)
- Mobile version (planned)
- Different buttons, just one right one; missclick tracking (planned)

## 🛠️ Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- React (since I want to learn it starting in this project)
- (TDD - I want to learn the concept)

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1. Start the local server

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the backend (in ./backend)
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
